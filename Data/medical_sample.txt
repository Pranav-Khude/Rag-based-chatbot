Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. It is typically defined as having a blood pressure above 140/90 and is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120.

Symptoms of hypertension include headaches, dizziness, and nosebleeds, though it is often asymptomatic. It can lead to serious conditions like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.

Common treatments include lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, regular exercise, and medication like ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers.

Hypertension is diagnosed through multiple blood pressure readings taken over time. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help prevent high blood pressure and its associated risks.
